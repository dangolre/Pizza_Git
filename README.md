# Pizza_Git

This program creates a class used to build a pizza. It has instance variables that store the size of pizza, whether it's veg or non-veg, the number of toppings and the price. The program includes a no-argument constructor, multi-argument constructors, getters and setters, toString and equals methods, and two additional methods to add extra toppings and extra cheese.
